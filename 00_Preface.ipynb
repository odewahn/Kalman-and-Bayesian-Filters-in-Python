If you read my book today, and then I make a change tomorrow, when you go back tomorrow you will see that change.

The chapter contents are in the notebook with the same name as the chapter name.

If you want to alter the code, you may do so and immediately see the effects of your change. If you find a bug, you can make a fix, and push it back to my repository so that everyone in the world benefits. And, of course, you will never encounter a problem I face all the time with traditional books - the book and the code are out of sync with each other, and you are left scratching your head as to which source to trust."

After that I have questions in my mind as to the best way to present the statistics needed to understand the filters. I try to avoid the 'dump a sememster of math into 4 pages' approash of most textbooks, but then again perhaps I put things off a bit too long. In any case, the subsequent chapters are due a strong editting cycle where I decide how to best develop these concepts. Otherwise I am pretty happy with the content for the one dimensional and multidimensional Kalman filter chapters. I know the code works, I am using it in real world projects at work, but there are areas where the content about the covariance matrices is pretty bad. The implementation is fine, the description is poor. Sorry. It will be corrected. \n",

They always has a fearsome reputation for difficulty, and I did not have the requisite education. Everyone I met that did implement them had multiple graduate courses on the topic and extensive industrial experience with them. As I moved into solving tracking problems with computer vision the need to implement them myself became urgent. There are classic textbooks in the field, such as Grewal and Andrew's excellent *Kalman Filtering*. But sitting down and trying to read many of these books is a dismal and trying experience if you do not have the background. Typically the first few chapters fly through several years of undergraduate math, blithely referring you to textbooks on, for example, It\u014d calculus, and presenting an entire semester's worth of statistics in a few brief paragraphs. These books are good textbooks for an upper undergraduate course, and an invaluable reference to researchers and professionals, but the going is truly difficult for the more casual reader. Symbology is introduced without explanation, different texts use different words and variables names for the same concept, and the books are almost devoid of examples or worked problems. I often found myself able to parse the words and comprehend the mathematics of a definition, but had no idea as to what real world phenomena these words and math were attempting to describe. \"But what does that *mean?*\" was my repeated thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as I began to finally understand the Kalman filter I realized the underlying concepts are quite straightforward. A few simple probability rules, some intuition about how we integrate disparate knowledge to explain events in our everyday life and the core concepts of the Kalman filter are accessible. Kalman filters have a reputation for difficulty, but shorn of much of the formal terminology the beauty of the subject and of their math became clear to me, and I fell in love with the topic. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I began to understand the math and theory more difficulties itself. A book or paper's author makes some statement of fact and presents a graph as proof.  Unfortunately, why the statement is true is not clear to me, nor is the method by which you might make that plot obvious. Or maybe I wonder \"is this true if R=0?\"  Or the author provides pseudocode - at such a high level that the implementation is not obvious. Some books offer Matlab code, but I do not have a license to that expensive package. Finally, many books end each chapter with many useful exercises. Exercises which you need to understand if you want to implement Kalman filters for yourself, but exercises with no answers. If you are using the book in a classroom, perhaps this is okay, but it is terrible for the independent reader. I loathe that an author withholds information from me, presumably to avoid 'cheating' by the student in the classroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of this necessary, from my point of view. Certainly if you are designing a Kalman filter for a aircraft or missile you must thoroughly master of all of the mathematics and topics in a typical Kalman filter textbook. I just want to track an image on a screen, or write some code for my Arduino project. I want to know how the plots in the book are made, and chose different parameters than the author chose. I want to run simulations. I want to inject more noise in the signal and see how a filter performs. There are thousands of opportunities for using Kalman filters in everyday code, and yet this fairly straightforward topic is the provenance of rocket scientists and academics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wrote this book to address all of those needs. This is not the book for you if you program avionics for Boeing or design radars for Ratheon. Go get a degree at Georgia Tech, UW, or the like, because you'll need it. This book is for the hobbyist, the curious, and the working engineer that needs to filter or smooth data. \n",
      "\n",
      "This book is interactive. While you can read it online as static content, I urge you to use it as intended. It is written using IPython Notebook, which allows me to combine text, python, and python output in one place. Every plot, every piece of data in this book is generated from Python that is available to you right inside the notebook. Want to double the value of a parameter? Click on the Python cell, change the parameter's value, and click 'Run'. A new plot or printed output will appear in the book. \n",
      "\n",
      "This book has exercises, but it also has the answers. I trust you. If you just need an answer, go ahead and read the answer. If you want to internalize this knowledge, try to implement the exercise before you read the answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "This book has supporting libraries for computing statistics, plotting various things related to filters, and for the various filters that we cover. This does require a strong caveat; most of the code is written for didactic purposes. It is rare that I chose the most efficient solution (which often obscures the intent of the code), and in the first parts of the book I did not concern myself with numerical stability. This is important to understand - Kalman filters in aircraft are carefully designed and implemented to be numerically stable; the naive implementation is not stable in many cases. If you are serious about Kalman filters this book will not be the last book you need. My intention is to introduce you to the concepts and mathematics, and to get you to the point where the textbooks are approachable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, this book is free. The cost for the books required to learn Kalman filtering is somewhat prohibitive even for a Silicon Valley engineer like myself; I cannot believe the are within the reach of someone in a depressed economy, or a financially struggling student. I have gained so much from free software like Python, and free books like those from Allen B. Downey [here](http://www.greenteapress.com/) [1]. It's time to repay that. So, the book is free, it is hosted on free servers, and it uses only free and open software such as IPython and mathjax to create the book. "

I am staying more or less on the bleeding edge of Python 3 for the time being. If you follow my suggestion of installing Anaconda all of the versioning problems will be taken care of for you, and you will not alter or affect any existing installation of Python on your machine. I am aware that telling somebody to install a specific packaging system is not a long term solution, but I can either focus on endless regression testing for every minor code change, or work on delivering the book, and then doing one sweep through it to maximize compatibility. I opt for the latter. In the meantime I welcome bug reports if the book does not work on your platform.*\n",

A few cells will not run if you have an older version installed. This is merely a minor annoyance.\n",

      "You will need Python 2.7 or later installed. Almost all of my work is done in Python 3.4, but I periodically test on 2.7. I do not promise any specific check in will work in 2.7 however. I do use Python's \"from __future__ import ...\" statement to help with compatibility. For example, all prints need to use parenthesis. If you try to add, say, \"print 3.14\" into the book your script will fail; you must write \"print (3.4)\" as in Python 3.X.\n",

      "I am first and foremost a programmer. Most Kalman filtering and other engineering texts are written by mathematicians or engineers. As a result, the software is usually not production quality. I will take Paul Zarchan's book *Fundamentals of Kalman Filtering* as an example. This is a fantastic book and it belongs in your library. But the code is Fortran listing without any subroutines beyond calls to functions like `MATMUL`. This means that Kalman filters are reimplemented over and over again throughout the book. The same listing mixes simulation code with filtering code, so until you become aware of the author's naming style it can be difficult to ascertain what code is the filter and what code is the simulation. Some chapters implement the same filter in subtley different ways, and uses bold text to highlight the few lines that changed. If he needs to use Runge Kutta, that is just embedded in the code, without comments. \n",
      "\n",
      "There's a better way. If I want to perform an SVD I call `svd`, I do not embed an svd implementation in my code. This buys me several things. First, I don't have to reimplement SVD multiple times. I don't have to debug SVD several times, and if I do find a bud, I can fix it once and be assured that it now works across all my different projects. Finally, it is readable. It is rare that I care about the implementation of SVD in my projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this is a textbook on Kalman filtering, and you could reasonably point out that we *do* care about the implementation of Kalman filters. To an extent that is true, but as you will find out the code that performs the filtering amounts to 7 or so lines of code. The code to implement the math is fairly trivial. Most of the work that Kalman filters requires is the design of the matrices that get fed into the math engine. So that is how I have structured the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, there is a class named `KalmanFilter` which implements the linear algebra for performing kalmaning filtering. To use it you will construct an object of that class, initialize various parameters, then enter a while loop where you call `KalmanFilter.predict()` and `KalmanFilter.update()` to incorporate your measurements. Thus most of your programs will be only 20-50 lines, most of that boilerplate - setting up the matrices, and then plotting and/or using the results. The possible downside of that is that the equations that perform the filtering are hidden behind functions, which we could argue is a loss in a pedagogical text. I argue the converse. I want you to learn how to use Kalman filters in the real world, for real projects, and you shouldn't be cutting and pasting established algorithms all over the place. If you want to use ode45 (Runga Kutta) you call that function, you don't reimplement it from scratch. We will do the same here.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is undeniable that you will be a bit less versed with the equations of the Kalman filter as a result. I strongly recommend looking at the source for FilterPy, and maybe even implementing your own filter from scratch to be sure you understand the concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use a fair number of classes in FilterPy. I do not use inheritence or virtual functions or any of that sort of OO design. I use classes as a way to organize the data that the filters require. For example, the `KalmanFilter` class mentioned above stores matrices called `x`, `P`, `R`, `Q`, and more. I've seen procedural libraries for Kalman filters, and they require the programmer to maintain all of those matrices. This perhaps isn't so bad for a toy program, but start programming, say, a bank of Kalman filters and you will not enjoy having to manage all of those matrices and other associated data.\n",
      "\n",
      "A word on variable names. I am an advocate for descriptive variable names. `R` is not, normally, descriptive. `R` is the measurement noise covaraiance matrix, so I could reasonably call it `measurement_noise_covariance`, and I've seen libraries do that. I've chosen not to do that. Why? In the end, Kalman filtering is math. To write a Kalman filter you are going to have to start by sitting down with a piece of paper and doing some math. You will be writing normal algrebric equations. Also, every Kalman filter text and source on the web uses the same linear algebra equations. You cannot read about the Kalman filter without seeing\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{Fx} + \\mathbf{Gu}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "in every source (a few sources use A and B instead of F and G). One of my goals in this book is to bring you to the point where you can read the original literature on Kalman filtering. I take an optimistic tone in this book - that Kalman filtering is easy to learn - and in many ways it is. However, for nontrivial problems the difficulty is not the implementation of the equations, but learning how to set up the equations so they solve your problem. In other words, every Kalman filter will implement $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{Fx} + \\mathbf{Gu}$; the difficult part is figuring out what to put in the matrices $\\mathbf{F}$ and $\\mathbf{G}$ to make your filter work for your problem. Vast amounts of work have been done to figure out how to apply Kalman filters in various domains, and it would be tragic to not be able to read the literature and avail yourself of this research. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, like it or not you will need to learn that $\\mathbf{F}$ is the *state transition matrix* and that $\\mathbf{R}$ is the *measurement noise covariance*. Once you know that the code will become readable, and until you know that all publications and web articles on Kalman filters will be inaccessible to you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally I feel that mathematical programming is somewhat different than regular programming; what is readable in one domain is not readable in another. `q = x + m` is opaque in a normal context. On the other hand, `x = .5*a*t**2 + v_0 * t + x_0` is to me the most readable way to write the Newtonian distance equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ x = \\frac{1}{2}at^2 + v_0 t + x_0$$\n",

      "    \n",
      "but I feel that obscures readability. This is surely debatable for this one equation; but most mathematical programs, and certainly Kalman filters, use systems of equations. I can most easily follow the code, and ensure that it does not have bugs, when it reads as close to the math as possible. Consider this equation taken from the Kalman filter:\n",

      "\n",
      "I grant you this version has more context, but I cannot reasonable glance at this and see what math it is implementing. In particular, the linear algebra $HPH^T$ is doing something very specific - multiplying P by H and its transpose is changing the *basis* of P. It is nearly impossible to see that the Kalman gain is just a ratio of one number divided by a second number which has been converted to a different basis. If you are not solid in linear algebra perhaps that statement does not convey a lot of information to you yet, but I assure you that $K = PH^T[HPH^T + R]^{-1}$ is saying something very succinctly. There are two key pieces of information here - we are taking a ratio, and we are converting the *basis* of a matrix. I can see that in my first Python line, I cannot see that in the second line.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I will not *win* this argument, and some people will not agree with my naming choices. I will finish by stating, very truthfully, that I made two mistakes the first time I typed that second version and it took me awhile to find it. In any case, I aim for using the mathematical symbol names whenever possible, coupled with readable class and function names. So, it is `KalmanFilter.P`, not `KF.P` and not `KalmanFilter.apriori_state_covariance`. "
