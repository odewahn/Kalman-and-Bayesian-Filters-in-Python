Sure, I hand waved some equations away, but I hope implementation has been fairly straightforward for you. The underlying concept is quite straightforward - take two measurements, or a measurement and a prediction, and choose the output to be somewhere between the two. If you believe the measurement more your guess will be closer to the measurement, and if you believe the prediction is more accurate your guess will lie closer it it. That's not rocket science (little joke - it is exactly this math that got Apollo to the moon and back!). \n",

For any arbitrary problem finding some of the matrices that we need to feed into the Kalman filter equations can be quite difficult. I haven't been *too tricky*, though. Equations like Newton's equations of motion can be trivially computed for Kalman filter applications, and they make up the bulk of the kind of problems that we want to solve. If you are a hobbyist, you can safely pass by this chapter for now, and perhaps forever. Some of the later chapters will assume the material in this chapter, but much of the work will still be accessible to you. \n",

There was enough going on in the earlier chapters that adding this form of reasoning about filters could be a distraction rather than a help. I now which to take some time to explain what Bayesian probability is and how a Kalman filter is in fact a Bayesian filter. This is not just a diversion. First of all, a lot of the Kalman filter literature uses this formulation when talking about filters, so you will need to understand what they are talking about. Second, this math plays a strong role in filtering design once we move past the Kalman filter. \n",

Recall the update step - we believed with some degree of precision that the dog was at position 7 (for example), and then receive a measurement that the dog is at position 7.5. We want to incorporate that measurement into our belief. In the *Discrete Bayes* chapter we used histograms to denote our estimates at each halway position, and in the \n",

For example, suppose you are driving down your neighborhood street and see one of your neighbors at their door, using a key to let themselves in. Three doors down you see two people in masks breaking a window of another house. What might you conclude?\n",

In the second case, perhaps the owners of the house were at a costume event at the next house, they had a medical emergency with their child, realized they lost their keys, and were breaking into their own house to get the much needed medication. Those are both *unlikely* events, but possible. Adding a few additional pieces of information would allow you to determine the true state of affairs in all but the most complicated situations.\n",

      "These are instances of *Bayesian* reasoning. We take knowledge from the past and integrate in new information. You know that your neighbor owned their house yesterday, so it is still highly likely that they still own it today. You know that owners of houses normally have keys to the front door, and that the normal mode of entrance into your own house is not breaking windows, so the second case is *likely* to be a breaking and entering. The reasoning is not ironclad as shown by the alternative explanations, but it is likely."

      "I promised that you would not have to understand how to derive Kalman filter equations, and that is true. However, I do think it is worth walking through the equations one by one and becoming familiar with the variables. If this is your first time through the material feel free to skip ahead to the next section. However, you will eventually want to work through this material, so why not now? You will need to have passing familiarity with these equations to read material written about the Kalman filter, as they all presuppose that you are familiar with them.

      "The blue point labeled \"prediction\" is the output of $\\mathbf{Hx}$, and the dot labeled \"measurement\" is $\\mathbf{z}$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{z} - \\mathbf{Hx}$ is how we compute the residual, drawn in red, where $\\mathbf{z}$ is the residual.\n",

      "Unfortunately it is a fair amount of linear algebra to derive this. The derivation can be quite elegant, and I urge you to look it up if you have the mathematical education to follow it. But $\\mathbf{K}$ is just the *Kalman gain* - the ratio of how much measurement vs prediction we should use to create the new estimate. $\\mathbf{R}$ is the *measurement noise*, and $\\mathbf{P}$ is our *uncertainty covariance matrix* from the prediction step.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let's work through this expression by expression. Start with $\\mathbf{HPH}^\\mathsf{T}$. The linear equation $\\mathbf{ABA}^T$ can be thought of as changing the basis of $\\mathbf{B}$ to $\\mathbf{A}$. So $\\mathbf{HPH}^\\mathsf{T}$ is taking the covariance $\\mathbf{P}$ and putting it in measurement ($\\mathbf{H}$) space. \n",
      "\n",
      "In English, consider the problem of reading a temperature with a thermometer that provices readings in volts. Our state is in terms of temperature, but we are now doing calculations in *measurement space* - volts. So we need to convert $\\mathbf{P}$ from applying to temperatures to volts. The linear algebra form $\\textbf{H}\\textbf{P}\\textbf{H}^\\mathsf{T}$ takes $\\mathbf{P}$ to the basis used by $\\mathbf{H}$, namely volts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, once in measurement space, we can add the measurement noise $\\mathbf{R}$ to it. Hence, the expression for the uncertainty once we include the measurement is:\n",

      "In general the design of the $\\mathbf{Q}$ matrix is among the most difficult aspects of Kalman filter design. This is due to several factors. First, the math itself is somewhat difficult and requires a good foundation in signal theory. Second, we are trying to model the noise in something for which we have little information. For example, consider trying to model the process noise for a baseball. We can model it as a sphere moving through the air, but that leave many unknown factors - the wind, ball rotation and spin decay, the coefficient of friction of a scuffed ball with stitches, the effects of wind and air density, and so on. I will develop the equations for an exact mathematical solution for a given process model, but since the process model is incomplete the result for $\\mathbf{Q}$ will also be incomplete. This has a lot of ramifications for the behavior of the Kalman filter. If $\\mathbf{Q}$ is too small than the filter will be overconfident in it's prediction model and will diverge from the actual solution. If $\\mathbf{Q}$ is too large than the filter will be unduly influenced by the noise in the measurements and perform suboptimally. In practice we spend a lot of time running simulations and evaluating collected data to try to select an appropriate value for $\\mathbf{Q}$. But let's start by looking at the math.\n",

However, this depends on what assumptions we make about the behavior of the noise. We will consider two different models for the noise."
